Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install barchart_data

## Usage

***Best Run Time:***  7PM PST (2AM GMT) as data stabalizes.

***Be Kind***  Test against the file test/test_files/athigh.php and limit hits against site.

## Prevent Duplicate Records
There should only be one record per symbol per date.


**AllTimeHigh**

    class AllTimeHigh < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates :symbol, uniqueness: { scope: :saved_on }
    end


## Future Features:
*  52-Week High
*  All-Time-Low
*  52-Week Low
*  Current New Highs/Lows
*  Error Handling
